/**
 * Provisions an X.509-SVID from the SPIFFE Workload API into a TLS registry configuration.
 * <p>
 * The SPIFFE client fetches the workload certificate (X.509-SVID) together with its private key and the trust bundle
 * and registers them as a named TLS configuration that other extensions can reference to perform mutual TLS.
 * <p>
 * A single workload has one X.509-SVID, but it can be provisioned into more than one TLS configuration,
 * for example to validate a different peer {@link #spiffeId()} per target.
 * <p>
 * Using this annotation requires the Quarkus TLS registry extension ({@code quarkus-tls-registry}) to be present; the
 * build fails otherwise.
 * <p>
 * The generated TLS configuration enforces the {@link #spiffeId()} authorization through the TLS registry options.
 * Extensions that consume its raw key store or trust store directly are unsupported and fail fast, since a raw store
 * cannot carry that authorization.
